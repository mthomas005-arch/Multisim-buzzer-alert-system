# Multisim-buzzer-alert-system
Designed and simulated a logic-based buzzer alert system using Multisim, implementing AND gates, D flip-flops, LEDs, and a buzzer to demonstrate digital control and alert mechanisms.
 Logic-Based Buzzer Alert System (Multisim)

This project is a digital logic–based buzzer alert system designed and simulated using NI Multisim.  
It demonstrates the use of logic gates, flip-flops, and output indicators to create a functional alert system.

---

 Project Overview

The system processes multiple digital inputs through AND gates and D flip-flops to control LEDs and activate a buzzer when predefined logic conditions are met.  
It simulates how digital logic can be used in alarm systems, access control, and alert mechanisms.
